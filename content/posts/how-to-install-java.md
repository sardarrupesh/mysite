## Step 1: Verify Java Requirements

Before you begin, ensure that your system meets the requirements for Java installation. You need a working internet connection and a compatible operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

## Step 2: Download Java Development Kit (JDK)

Visit the official Oracle website or an open-source alternative like OpenJDK to download the Java Development Kit (JDK). Choose the appropriate version based on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).

## Step 3: Install JDK on Windows

For Windows users, run the downloaded installer (.exe file) and follow the installation wizard. Make sure to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the directory where JDK is installed.

```bash
setx -m JAVA_HOME "C:\Path\To\Your\JDK"
setx -m PATH "%PATH%;%JAVA_HOME%\bin"
```

## Step 4: Install JDK on macOS

For macOS users, open the downloaded `.dmg` file and follow the installation instructions. After installation, set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable by editing your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`).

```bash
echo 'export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Step 5: Install JDK on Linux

For Linux users, extract the downloaded tarball and move it to the desired installation directory. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable in your shell configuration file.

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/jdk
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
```

## Step 6: Verify Java Installation

Open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command to check if Java is installed successfully:

```bash
java -version
```

You should see information about the installed Java version.

## Time Complexity and Efficiency Analysis

The provided code `BasicMathematics` offers various approaches for counting digits and reversing numbers. Here's a breakdown of their time complexity and efficiency levels:

**Counting Digits:**

* **Using String:**
    - Time Complexity: O(n) in the worst case, where n is the number of digits. This is because converting the number to a String requires iterating through its digits once.
    - Efficiency: Least efficient due to String manipulation overhead.

* **Using Loop:**
    - Time Complexity: O(log n) on average. The loop iterates until the number becomes 0, and the number of iterations roughly corresponds to the number of digits (logarithm of the number).
    - Efficiency: More efficient than String conversion, especially for larger numbers.

* **Using Logarithm:**
    - Time Complexity: O(1) in theory, as the `Math.log10` function is a constant-time operation. However, calculating the absolute value and converting the result to an integer might add slight overhead.
    - Efficiency: Most efficient for constant-time lookup, but may have slight overhead compared to the loop for practical usage.

**Reversing Numbers:**

* **Using While Loop:**
    - Time Complexity: O(log n) on average. Similar to counting digits, the loop iterates until the number becomes 0.
    - Efficiency: Efficient and easy to understand.

* **Using For Loop:**
    - Time Complexity: O(log n) on average, similar to the while loop approach.
    - Efficiency: Similar efficiency to the while loop, with slightly different syntax.

* **Using Recursion:**
    - Time Complexity: O(log n) on average, but can be slightly slower due to function call overhead.
    - Efficiency: Less efficient than loops for this specific task, although recursion can be powerful for other problems.

* **Using String Conversion:**
    - Time Complexity: O(n) in the worst case, similar to counting digits with strings.
    - Efficiency: Least efficient due to String manipulation overhead for both conversion and reversal.


**General Recommendations:**

* For counting digits:
    - Use loops for good balance of efficiency and simplicity.
    - Consider logarithms for constant-time lookup if needed, but be aware of potential overhead for practical scenarios.
    - Avoid string conversion due to its lower efficiency.

* For reversing numbers:
    - Use loops (while or for) for efficient and straightforward reversal.
    - Avoid recursion and string conversion for this specific task due to lower efficiency.

These recommendations are general guidelines. The best choice may depend on your specific needs and performance requirements.


Congratulations! You have successfully installed Java on your machine. Now you're ready to develop and run Java applications. Remember to keep your Java installation up-to-date for security and performance enhancements. Happy coding! ðŸš€


```java
class Solution {
    public int reverse(int x) {

        if(x == Integer.MIN_VALUE || x == Integer.MAX_VALUE){
            return 1;
        }

        int reverse = 0;
        int temp;

        int num = Math.abs(x);

        while (num != 0) {
            temp = num % 10;
            if (reverse > (Integer.MAX_VALUE - temp)/10 ) {
                return 0;
            }
            reverse = reverse * 10 + temp;
            num = num / 10;

        }

        return x < 0 ? -reverse : reverse;
    }
}
```
